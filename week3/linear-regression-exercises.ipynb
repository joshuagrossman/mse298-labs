    "⏮️ In the last lab, we covered the basics of the criminal pretrial process. \n",
    "\n",
    "⏭️ In this lab, we specifically consider federal pretrial detention.\n",
    "\n",
    "⚖️ In several federal jurisdictions (though not all!), the pretrial process proceeds as follows:\n",
    "1. First, there is an **initial hearing**.\n",
    "2. During the initial hearing, the prosecutor may recommend that the defendant should be detained before their trial (i.e., the prosecutor **\"moves to detain\"**).\n",
    "3. If the prosecutor does not move to detain, the defendant is typically released at the initial hearing.\n",
    "4. If the prosecutor moves to detain, the defendant is temporarily detained. Officers of the court take several days to learn more about the defendant.\n",
    "5. After this investigation, there is a **detention hearing**.\n",
    "6. At the detention hearing, the judge decides whether the defendant should be detained or released before their trial. \n",
    "\n",

    "🤝 For example, I may be interested in estimating the hiring rate for different combinations of gender, race, and age.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the previous exercise, you could use a `group_by` and `summarize` statement to calculate the observed hiring rate for each combination.\n",

    "👎 But, this approach has several downsides. For example:\n",
    "- You need a table with $g*r*a$ cells to communicate the results, where $g$ is the number of genders, $r$ is the number of race groups, and $a$ is the number of age groups.\n",
    "- How do I estimate hiring rates for cells with no data? For example, what if my sample has no 35 year-old Asian women?\n",
    "- Can I trust estimated hiring rates in cells with only a few data points, or with big outliers?\n",
